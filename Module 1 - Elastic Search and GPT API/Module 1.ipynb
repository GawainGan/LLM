      "To run Docker, you can follow these steps depending on what you need to do. Below are some relevant scenarios and solutions from the context provided:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Running a Docker Container on Windows:**\n",
      "   If you encounter the error message \"the input device is not a TTY,\" append `winpty` before your `docker run` command. For example:\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   winpty docker run -it ubuntu bash\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "   You can also create an alias to avoid typing `winpty` every time:\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   echo \"alias docker='winpty docker'\" >> ~/.bashrc\n",
      "   OR\n",
      "   echo \"alias docker='winpty docker'\" >> ~/.bash_profile\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Connecting to Docker Daemon:**\n",
      "   If you get the error \"Cannot connect to Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?\", ensure the Docker daemon is started. If using WSL, update it with the following command in PowerShell:\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   wsl --update\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Pulling Docker Images:**\n",
      "   To pull a Docker image, ensure you are using the correct repository name. For example:\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   docker pull dpage/pgadmin4\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "   If you encounter a \"permission denied\" error, it might indicate you are trying to access a private repository. In such a case, log in to Docker first and then pull the image:\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   docker login\n",
      "   docker pull <private-repo/image>\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Running a Docker Container with Mounted Volume (macOS M1):**\n",
      "   If there are permission issues when mounting a volume, ensure Docker Desktop is installed and not Rancher Desktop. For example:\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   docker run -it \\\n",
      "   -e POSTGRES_USER=\"root\" \\\n",
      "   -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=\"root\" \\\n",
      "   -e POSTGRES_DB=\"ny_taxi\" \\\n",
      "   -v $(pwd)/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \\\n",
      "   -p 5432:5432 \\\n",
      "   postgres:13\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Network Name:**\n",
      "   To get the Docker network name, use the following command:\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   docker network ls\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Fixing Pip Install Errors inside Docker Container on Windows:**\n",
      "   If you encounter name resolution errors when running pip inside a Docker container, use the following command:\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   winpty docker run -it --dns=8.8.8.8 --entrypoint=bash python:3.9\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Permissions for Docker-Compose on Google Cloud VM:**\n",
      "   If you installed docker-compose on a Google Cloud VM and it’s not recognized, ensure the file is named correctly. You might rename it from `docker-compose-linux-x86_64` to `docker-compose`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, always ensure your Docker setup (Docker daemon, Docker Desktop, and necessary permissions) is correctly configured to avoid common issues.\n"
